          You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a
          mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for
          murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I
          don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven
          of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
          oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that
          killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't
          hold a candle to man.{' '}

        <h1>Uuummmm, this is a tasty burger!</h1>

          Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to
          bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do.
          That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same
          way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our
          lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and
          I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.{' '}
